# Pylon
Pylon allows legacy Minecraft versions to run with LWJGL 3. It replaces the outdated windowing system with SDL 3, and serves as a library for mods.

## Downloads
* [Latest Release](https://github.com/notdevcody/pylon/releases/latest)
* [Latest Nightly](https://nightly.link/notdevcody/pylon/workflows/nightly/main/pylon-nightly.zip)

## Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> On versions **older than 1.6** a deAWT mod is required. [LegacyFix](https://github.com/betacraftuk/legacyfix) is recommended.

### Forge
Depending on the game version:
- 1.3 or older: Follow [Other](#Other).
- 1.4: Put the mod jar into the `.minecraft/coremods` folder.
- 1.5 or newer: Put the mod jar into the `.minecraft/mods` folder.

### Fabric
Put the mod jar into the `.minecraft/mods` folder.

### Other
If you are playing on Vanilla or using an older mod loader (like Risugami's), you need to install Pylon as a Java Agent.

Pylon can also be put in place of LWJGL2 directly, but game patches won't be available.
